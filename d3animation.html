    <!-- our SVG and all our stuff will appear dynamically in here -->

    <script type="text/javascript">

    /*Below, we create a variable called sampleSVG and then using d3's
    select functionality, we select the html item on our page with the 
    id of viz and put that item  into our variable. Now we can reference
    and make changes to our SVG as sampleSVG instead of always d3.select("#viz").
    What these 4 lines actually do is they take the div with the id of #viz and
    adding an SVG element to the div named "svg". (Note: We know this adds an 
    SVG element and not another kind of HTML element because d3 knows that "svg"
    implies that we're using the svg namespace, so it really appends "svg:svg"). 
    After append, we make the width and height of the SVG (not the DIV) 
    to be 200 px each.*/

    var sampleSVG = d3.select("#viz")
        .append("svg")
        .attr("width", 200)
        .attr("height", 200);  

        /*You may ask why we don't need semicolons after all of these lines of code.
        This is called method chaining, so we can do multiple method calls
        (.append() and .attr() are all d3 methods, or functions) in one statement.

        So, those statements above create an SVG with a code of:
          <svg width="100" height="100">
          <circle style="stroke: #808080; fill: #F0F8FF; " r="40" cx="50" cy="50"></circle>
          </svg>

        So now you may ask what's the point of doing  all these changes and
        generating this svg in JS instead of something like Illustrator?
        Here's why:
          - You can add, remove and modify multiple elements from an existing DOM
          - Dynamically add attributes and styles according to a function
          - Animate attributes and styles
          - Bind data to automatically add elements when needed
          - Benefits from a lot of helper functions

    Now we're going to create a circle inside of the SVG and style it to 
    have a grey outline, a radius of 40 px, and have a center point of (50,50).
    We're also going to make it so that when you mouseover the circle, the 
    color changes. On the next line, we set the opposite function, mouseout
    to fade the circle back to white as the mouse exits the circle. Then, on the 
    final line of this block, we set a function for a mousedown event, so we tell
    the browser to run the function called animateFirstStep (below) when we click
    on the circle.*/

    sampleSVG.append("circle")
        .style("stroke", "gray")
        .style("fill", "white")
        .attr("r", 40)
        .attr("cx", 50)
        .attr("cy", 50)
        .on("mouseover", function(){d3.select(this).style("fill", "aliceblue");})
        .on("mouseout", function(){d3.select(this).style("fill", "white");})
        .on("mousedown", animateFirstStep);


    /* The function below is run when a mousedown event (or click) happens on the
    circle svg. Basically, what is does is selects this, which is the object that
    that method is being called on. In this case, we called the function because of
    a click on the circle svg, so this will be the circle svg. ".transition" tells 
    the browser that the following code with be a d3 animation. We set the animation 
    delay to be 0, so it won't wait after clicking on the circle before it starts the
    animation. We then set the duration to 1000 ms. We set the attribute to be animated
    to be the radius, and that we want it animated to 10px. Then at the end, we
    call the function animateSecondStep (below). */
    function animateFirstStep(){
        d3.select(this)
          .transition()            
            .delay(0)            
            .duration(1000)
            .attr("r", 10)
            .each("end", animateSecondStep);
    };

    /* This function is pretty much the same as the last, it just animates this, or
    the svg circle, back into its orginal state. It works by selecting this, (the circle)
    and then transitioning the radius back to 40 px over the course of 1000ms. We don't
    need to call another function at the end of this, as our circle is now reset to the 
    original. */
    function animateSecondStep(){
        d3.select(this)
          .transition()
            .duration(1000)
            .attr("r", 40);
    };
